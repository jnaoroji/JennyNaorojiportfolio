          I'm currently a web development student studying online at the University of Adelaide, graduating in September 2023. This webpage showcases some of my current work. I have a bachelor's degree in Information Management, have been working as a Sommelier for the past 3 years and have been in the Hospitality industry for over 15 years.
          My passions inlude Food, Wine and Sport. I am a bubbly, competitive, hard worker. I am a quick
          learner and am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve and learn. I enjoy creating, establishing
          and maintaining business and customer relationships and strive to excel at this. My hospitality and customer
          service background has stemmed into a strong mental aptitude for working efficiently under pressure, and
          creative problem solving on the job. 
          I am looking for a role that will allow me to grow, take on new opportunities and responsibilities and teach
          me new skills. I have plenty of Customer Service, Supervisory, Management, Event and Operational experience
          and would love to work in a challenging environment.
